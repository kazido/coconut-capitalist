### TODO

# GENERALIZE THE BOT

[ ] remove all ties from specific guilds, roles, and channels.
[x] make ranks stored in the database rather than the server - they are now no longer tied to discord role IDs but instead just stored in the itemdatabase.db
[ ] store valid channels in the database for each guild.

## SMALLER FIXES

[ ] maybe move the games back into their own cogs? it's nice to have them all in one cog, but for development purposes, it's not practical to restart the bot every time there is a change. so probably move \_blackjack and \_high_low back to their own cogs for development purposes. can still be clean code.
[x] make it so 'k' and 'm' are valid options for thousand and million bets
[ ] change begging -> gives more bits but has a cooldown
[ ] possibly add party channels? removed them because I don't want it to be tied to the discord server at all, and custom channels would have to bet sent to a specific category for organization... could setup a marked category, but that would be a pain.

# MORE USES FOR TOKENS

[ ] Add some other functionality to tokens other than ranking up. Perhaps a limited item shop? - Actually, I'm not quite sure about this idea. I think having to choose between using tokens for something or using them to rank up would be awkward for a player, and eventually one meta would rise. Perhaps I could make it so that they have a use, but only after you've hit max rank. They feel pointless since they are linear and one dimensional, but maybe that is a good thing for something like ranking up.

# MORE STATISTICS

[x] Add a tracker in the database for each possible statistic we can think of - This is simply pure fun for the player, especially in a grindy game. It's always fun to compare with others how many drops you've claimed or how many nodes you've mined. - This will require the user model to get quite large... Maybe pick and choose which statistics are really worth keeping or not.
